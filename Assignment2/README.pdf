# Assignment 1

Display slice along user-specified axis and slice position!

## Minimum Requirements

- Download data into 3D volume texture. :heavy_check_mark:
- Display 3 different axis-aligned slices using OpenGL texture mapping and the 3D volume texture. :heavy_check_mark:
- The slice position should be adjustable for each slice view. :heavy_check_mark:
- Make sure the aspect ratio of the shown slices is correct. :heavy_check_mark:
- If the window is resized, the slice is resized with the correct aspect ratio (no distortions) :heavy_check_mark:

## Bonus
- Show all three axis aligned slices at once. :heavy_check_mark:
- Show arbitrarily aligned slices with an interface to change the arbitrary slice. :x:
